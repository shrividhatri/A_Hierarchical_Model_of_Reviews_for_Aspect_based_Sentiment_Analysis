# A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Reviews_for_Aspect_based_Sentiment_Analysis

## Problem Statement

Mining the opinion of the reviews has become an important problem in recent years
due to the increasing popularity of online retailers, review blogs, etc. This helps us
gauge the user sentiment towards a particular product or service that is of use to many
entities, including prospective customers, business owners and service providers.

For sentiment analysis of reviews, each sentence of the review are usually classified
independently, although they form a part of the review's argumentative structure. A
the sentence in a review is rarely an individual entity, and more often than not, is a part of a
collection of sentences which build and elaborate on each other, and together form the
case either for or against the product.

The proposed method uses a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis of reviews, which models the interdependencies of sentences
in a review.
